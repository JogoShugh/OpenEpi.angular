<h3>About OpenEpi</h3>

<div class='well'>
<p>
OpenEpi provides statistics for counts and measurements in descriptive and analytic studies, stratified analysis with
exact confidence limits, matched pair and person-time analysis, sample size and power calculations, random numbers,
sensitivity, specificity and other evaluation statistics, R x C tables, chi-square for dose-response, and links to
other useful sites.
</p>
<p>
OpenEpi is free and open source software for epidemiologic statistics. It can be run from a web server or downloaded
and run without a web connection. A server is not required. The programs are written in JavaScript and HTML, and should
be compatible with recent Linux, Mac, and PC browsers, regardless of operating system. (If you are seeing this, your
browser settings are allowing JavaScript.) The programs can be run in the browsers of many iPhone and
Android cellphones.
</p>
<p>
Test results are provided for each module so that you can judge reliability, although it is always a good idea to check
important results with software from more than one source. Links to hundreds of Internet calculators are provided.
</p>
<p>
The programs have an open source license and can be downloaded, distributed, or translated. Some of the components
from other sources have licensing statements in the source code files. Licenses referred to are available in full text
at <a href='http://opensource.org/licenses'>OpenSource.org/licenses</a>. OpenEpi development was supported
in part by a grant from the <a href='http://www.gatesfoundation.org/'>Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</a> to
Emory University, <a href='http://www.sph.emory.edu/'>Rollins School of Public Health</a>.
</p>
<p>
A toolkit for creating new modules and for translation is included. Please let us know if you would like to
collaborate in this way. Suggestions, comments, and expressions of interest in contributing to this effort should be
sent by email to: <a href='mailto:andy.dean@gmail.com'>andy.dean@gmail.com</a>,
